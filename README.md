For Cogoport Academy

Description:
- Use https://editor.p5js.org/ for real-time editing of the code.
- Starting point can be the paste-bin link I shared for the code

Test Cases:
- The ball should hit the top of the paddle and bounce of it.
- Create a brick (rectangle) anywhere on the screen
- When the ball hits the brick, the brick should hide.

Addtional Points:
- Add a score text and increment the score once you hit the brick.
